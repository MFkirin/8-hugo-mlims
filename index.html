                <p>Being for many like the 5th element of hip-hop; although others consider it a universal instrument
                without attached styles, it focuses on the study and application of body music and language
                bodily. Commonly refers to the act of creating rhythmic sounds and the language of the parts of the
                body, especially in the throat, mouth and hands. Its practitioners are known as Human
                Beat Boxes, Human Orchestras or Beatboxers.</p>

                <p>It is a form of vocal percussion that is based on the ability to produce drum sounds, rhythms and
                musical sounds using one's own mouth, lips, tongue and voice. It may also include singing,

            <h3>Source</h3>

            <p>Beatboxing is trying to see and use the body as an instrument. Earlier versions of this expression
                included the hand bone, or hambone. However, the modern beat box originated from the act of initially
                imitating electronic drum machines.</p>

                <p>The first electronic drum machines were some of the original beat boxes; and the skills to imitate were
                called beat boxin. But, the old beat boxin was the ability to imitate the sounds of nature with one of
                the parts of one's own body. Not only is beatboxing a form of communication, it's the actual language of
                hip-hop.</p>

                <p>The beatbox is at the genesis of human consciousness. Mimicking the sounds of nature (or the natural
                environment) to communicate ideas and feelings is at the beginning of human consciousness, knowledge,
                and survival.</p>

            <h3>Characteristic</h3>

            <p>This talent is much more complex than blowing with rhythm. It requires a great deal of practice,
                technique, breath control, natural rhythm, coordination, and knowledge. The performer will often imitate
                familiar themes or improvise rhythms very similar to a jazz musician by singing in a scat style or by
                humming.</p>

                <p>Early performers included Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie, Gregorio de Niza and Buff Amor (also known as The
                Ox That Rox from The Fat Boys). But more recently, the art form was taken to new levels, most notably by
                Rahzel of The Roots who honed the technique of beatboxing and singing at the same time, legitimizing the
                art form as a musical medium in its own right.</p>

                <p>In recent years, British beatboxer Beardyman has come to be recognized as one of, if not the best in the
                world. He combines acting with comedy as well as incredible levels of talent to produce a unique show,
                blending different forms of music, from jazz to pop, hip-hop to rock, drums to bass and beyond. .</p>
