            <p>Growl Up France is an association created on the initiative of an Angevin beatboxer (Orfey), who knew how
                to surround himself with a small group of passionate people who are invested in their city: Angers.
                Their goal is to pursue the creation and organization of projects bringing together several artistic
                disciplines in the form of battles. All motivated by common goals: to promote musical sharing and
                democratize urban culture! Thanks to many skills, knowledge and a strong network of cultural actors in
                the city, the team has chosen for this 3rd edition, which will take place on December 22 in Angers, to
                organize things on a large scale and independently!</p>

            <h3>Format</h3>
            <p>8 instrumentalists and 8 beatboxers are drawn to form duos (called "tag team" in human beatbox battles),
                i.e. one instrumentalist and one beatboxer per team.</p>

            <p> These teams have a fair and well-established time to get to know each other and work together over the
                course of an afternoon. Arrived at the end of the allocated time, the teams are ready to compete in the
                form of battles during the evening open to the public.</p>

            <p>The pairs are drawn at 12:00 p.m. The participants will then rehearse, divided into pairs, in spaces
                reserved for them and protected from their competitors. The clock is on, they have 4 hours to meet and
                exchange their music.</p>

            <p>The 8 teams must each plan 14 minutes of show, 3min for the quarter-finals, 3min for the semi-finals and
                8min for the final phases (small and big final).</p>

            <p>The battles take place in a concert hall, at dusk, under the watchful eye of a jury made up of five
                artists: two beatboxers, an instrumentalist and two beatboxer-instrumentalists. Finally, so as not to
                lose a second of music, showcases are offered between the battles.</p>
